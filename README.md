# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The challenge is to build a command-line SVG Logo Generator. The Logo is defined by a shape and a color, which is determined through user input. The shape options are Circle, Square, or Triangle. The color is broader as the user can input either names or hexadecimal values. After the user completes the input questions, the logo will be generated within the 'logos' folder and can be viewed in the live server.

## User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```
